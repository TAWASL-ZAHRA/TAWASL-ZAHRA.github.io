    <h1>Bobber Bikes: The Iconic Ride</h1>
    <img src="Screenshot_2024-03-28_220118-removebg-preview.png" alt="boober Bike">
    <p>Bobber bikes, with their stripped-down style and minimalist design, have become an emblem of the classic American motorcycle culture. Let's explore the features, parts, and specifications that make bobber bikes stand out on the road.</p>

    <div class="specs">
        <h2>Frame and Construction:</h2>
        <p>Bobber bikes are known for their distinctive frame design, characterized by a low-slung profile and a rigid rear end. These frames are typically made of steel or aluminum for durability and stability. The minimalist frame allows for a clean and uncluttered look, showcasing the bike's essential components.</p>

        <h2>Engine and Performance:</h2>
        <p>Bobber bikes often feature powerful V-twin engines, known for their torquey performance and distinctive sound. Engine sizes can vary from 600cc to over 2000cc, providing plenty of power for cruising on highways or navigating city streets. The exposed engine and exhaust pipes add to the bike's rugged appeal.</p>

        <h2>Suspension and Handling:</h2>
        <p>Traditional bobber bikes have a hardtail rear suspension, meaning there is no rear suspension system. This setup enhances the bike's retro look and provides a firm ride feel. However, modern bobber models may feature a hidden rear suspension to improve comfort without sacrificing style. The front suspension is typically a telescopic fork for responsive handling and a smooth ride.</p>

        <h2>Wheels and Tires:</h2>
        <p>Bobber bikes usually sport spoked wheels with wide tires, providing stability and traction on various road surfaces. The wheels are often smaller in diameter, with sizes ranging from 16 to 21 inches, contributing to the bike's low-slung stance. Tires may have a vintage-inspired tread pattern for added aesthetic appeal.</p>
