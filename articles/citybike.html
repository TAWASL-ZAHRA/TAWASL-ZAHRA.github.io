    <h1>City Bikes: Navigating Urban Landscapes with Style and Convenience</h1>
    <img src="city-removebg-preview.png" alt="city Bike">
    
    <p>City bikes, also known as urban or commuter bikes, are designed to navigate the bustling streets of cities with ease and comfort. Let's explore the features, parts, and specifications that make city bikes the perfect choice for urban commuters.</p>

    <div class="specs">
        <h2>Frame and Construction:</h2>
        <p>City bikes typically feature lightweight frames made of aluminum or steel, providing durability and agility in urban environments. The geometry of city bike frames is designed for comfort and ease of handling, with an upright riding position that offers excellent visibility in traffic.</p>

        <h2>Wheels and Tires:</h2>
        <p>City bikes come with medium-sized wheels, usually around 26 to 700c inches in diameter, offering a good balance between agility and stability. Tires are moderately wide for added comfort and traction on city streets, typically ranging from 28mm to 35mm in width.</p>

        <h2>Gearing:</h2>
        <p>Most city bikes feature a simple and reliable gearing system, with options for single-speed, internal hub gears, or traditional derailleur setups. Single-speed city bikes offer low maintenance and simplicity, ideal for short urban commutes. Internal hub gears provide smooth shifting and are protected from dirt and grime, while traditional derailleurs offer a wider range of gears for tackling hills and longer distances.</p>

        <h2>Brakes:</h2>
        <p>City bikes are equipped with efficient braking systems, typically either rim brakes or disc brakes. Rim brakes are lightweight and easy to maintain, while disc brakes offer consistent performance in all weather conditions and provide better stopping power, especially in wet or muddy environments.</p>

        <h2>Measurements and Statistics:</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Specification</th>
                <th>Range</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Frame Sizes</td>
                <td>48cm to 60cm</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Wheelbase</td>
                <td>1000mm to 1100mm</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Weight</td>
                <td>20 to 30 pounds</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Special Features:</h2>
        <p>City bikes often come with practical features tailored for urban commuting, such as fenders to protect riders from splashes, racks or baskets for carrying groceries or other essentials, and integrated lights for visibility in low-light conditions. Some models may also include chainguards to keep clothing clean and chain locks for added security when parking in the city.</p>
