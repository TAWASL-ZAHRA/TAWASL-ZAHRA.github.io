    <h1>Dirt Bikes: Conquering the Off-Road Terrain</h1>
    <img src="04-removebg-preview.png" alt="dirtBike">
    
    <p>Dirt bikes, also known as off-road motorcycles, are purpose-built machines designed to handle the rugged challenges of unpaved terrain. Let's explore the features, parts, and specifications that make dirt bikes the ultimate thrill-seekers' choice.</p>

    <div class="specs">
        <h2>Frame and Construction:</h2>
        <p>Dirt bikes feature lightweight yet durable frames, typically made of aluminum or chromoly steel. These frames are engineered to withstand the rigors of off-road riding while providing agility and maneuverability. The frame geometry is optimized for stability and control in rough terrain, with a higher ground clearance to clear obstacles.</p>

        <h2>Engine and Performance:</h2>
        <p>The heart of a dirt bike is its engine, which is usually a single-cylinder, four-stroke or two-stroke powerplant. Engine sizes vary widely, ranging from 50cc for entry-level bikes to over 500cc for high-performance models. Two-stroke engines are known for their instant power delivery and lightweight design, while four-stroke engines offer smoother power delivery and better fuel efficiency.</p>

        <h2>Suspension and Handling:</h2>
        <p>Dirt bikes are equipped with long-travel suspension systems to soak up bumps and jumps off-road. The front forks and rear shock absorbers are adjustable to suit different rider preferences and terrain conditions. The suspension travel can range from 8 to 12 inches, providing ample cushioning for aggressive riding.</p>

        <h2>Wheels and Tires:</h2>
        <p>Dirt bikes come with knobby tires designed for maximum traction in dirt, mud, and sand. The wheels are usually made of lightweight aluminum alloy to reduce unsprung weight and improve handling. Tire sizes vary depending on the bike's intended use, with larger diameters for motocross and smaller sizes for trail riding.</p>

        <h2>Measurements and Statistics:</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Specification</th>
                <th>Range</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Overall Length</td>
                <td>2 meters</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Seat Height</td>
                <td>85cm to 95cm</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Weight</td>
                <td>90kg to 140kg</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Special Features:</h2>
        <p>Dirt bikes often come with specialized features to enhance performance and durability. These may include disc brakes for precise stopping power, high-performance exhaust systems for improved airflow, and adjustable handlebars and footpegs for rider comfort. Some models also offer electric start systems and fuel injection for easy starting and smooth power delivery.</p>
