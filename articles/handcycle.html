    <h1>The Handcycle Revolution</h1>
    <img src="handbike-removebg-preview.png" alt="handcycles">
    <p>Handcycles are innovative and empowering mobility devices designed for individuals with lower body impairments or disabilities. Let's delve into the features, parts, and specifications that make handcycles a game-changer in adaptive sports and recreational activities.</p>

    <div class="specs">
        <h2>Frame and Construction:</h2>
        <p>Handcycles feature lightweight frames typically made of aluminum or carbon fiber, ensuring durability and maneuverability. The frame design allows the rider to sit comfortably while pedaling with their hands. Some models offer adjustable seat positions to accommodate different body types and riding preferences.</p>

        <h2>Wheels and Tires:</h2>
        <p>Handcycles are equipped with three wheels: two large drive wheels at the front and a smaller steering wheel at the rear. The drive wheels are usually larger, providing stability and traction. Tires are designed for various terrains, ranging from smooth pavement to rough off-road trails, with widths and treads optimized for grip and performance.</p>

        <h2>Gearing:</h2>
        <p>Handcycles come with a wide range of gearing options to suit different riding conditions and preferences. They typically feature multiple gears operated by hand levers, allowing riders to adjust their pedaling resistance for climbing hills or cruising on flat terrain. Some models may also offer electronic shifting for added convenience and precision.</p>

        <h2>Brakes:</h2>
        <p>Handcycles are equipped with effective braking systems for safety and control. Most models feature disc brakes, providing reliable stopping power in all weather conditions. Hand-operated brake levers allow riders to modulate their braking force for smooth and controlled stops.</p>

        <h2>Measurements and Statistics:</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Specification</th>
                <th>Range</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Overall Length</td>
                <td>180cm to 220cm</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Overall Width</td>
                <td>70cm to 100cm</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Weight</td>
                <td>20kg to 40kg</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Special Features:</h2>
        <p>Handcycles often include specialized features to enhance comfort, performance, and accessibility. These may include adjustable seat angles, ergonomic hand grips, and padded seats for long rides. Some models offer suspension systems to absorb shocks and vibrations, providing a smoother ride over rough terrain. Additionally, handcycles may feature storage compartments or attachment points for carrying gear and accessories.</p>
