    <h1>Exploring the World of Fixed Gear Bikes: Features, Parts, and Specifications</h1>
    <img src="fixies-removebg-preview.png" alt="Fixies">
    
    <p>Fixed gear bikes, also known as fixies, have gained popularity for their simplicity, efficiency, and unique riding experience. Let's take a closer look at the features, parts, and specifications that make fixed gear bikes stand out in the world of cycling.</p>

    <div class="specs">
        <h2>Frame and Construction:</h2>
        <p>Fixed gear bikes typically feature lightweight frames made of materials such as steel, aluminum, or carbon fiber. Steel frames offer durability and a smooth ride, while aluminum provides a lighter option for agility and speed. Carbon fiber frames are the choice for high-end models, offering a perfect balance of strength and weight reduction.</p>

        <h2>Wheels and Tires:</h2>
        <p>One of the defining features of fixed gear bikes is their single-speed drivetrain and direct connection between the pedals and the rear wheel. This simplicity eliminates the need for derailleurs and allows for a more direct power transfer, resulting in a responsive and efficient ride.</p>

        <h2>Gearing:</h2>
        <p>Fixed gear bikes come with a single gear ratio, meaning there is no freewheel mechanism. The rider cannot coast and must continuously pedal to keep the bike moving. This setup provides a more connected feel with the bike and allows for better control, especially in urban environments where quick stops and starts are common.</p>

        <h2>Brakes:</h2>
        <p>While some fixed gear bikes come equipped with traditional brakes, many riders opt for a brakeless setup, relying on the resistance created by pedaling backward to slow down or stop. This minimalist approach to braking requires skill and awareness but can offer a more direct and responsive riding experience.</p>

        <h2>Measurements and Statistics:</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Specification</th>
                <th>Range</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Frame Sizes</td>
                <td>48cm to 62cm</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Wheel Sizes</td>
                <td>700c to 650c</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Weight</td>
                <td>18 to 22 pounds</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Special Features:</h2>
        <p>Fixed gear bikes often boast sleek, minimalist designs with customizable options such as handlebars, saddles, and color schemes. Some models may also include aerodynamic frames, deep-rimmed wheels, or track-specific components for racing enthusiasts.</p>
