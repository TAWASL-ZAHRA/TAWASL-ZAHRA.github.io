    <h1>Unleashing the Adventure: Exploring Gravel Bikes</h1>
    <img src="gravel-removebg-preview.png" alt="Gravel">
    
    <p>Gravel bikes have surged in popularity, offering riders the freedom to explore a variety of terrains with ease and comfort. Let's delve into the features, parts, and specifications that make gravel bikes the ultimate choice for adventurous cyclists.</p>

    <div class="specs">
        <h2>Frame and Construction:</h2>
        <p>Gravel bikes typically feature lightweight frames made of aluminum, steel, or carbon fiber. These materials provide durability and shock absorption, essential for handling rough terrain. The geometry of gravel bike frames is designed for stability and comfort on long rides, with relaxed angles and clearance for wider tires.</p>

        <h2>Wheels and Tires:</h2>
        <p>Gravel bikes are equipped with sturdy wheels and wide tires, providing traction and stability on gravel, dirt, and pavement. Wheel sizes are usually 700c, offering versatility for various riding conditions. Gravel-specific tires feature tread patterns optimized for grip and durability, with widths ranging from 32mm to 45mm to tackle different surfaces effectively.</p>

        <h2>Gearing:</h2>
        <p>Gravel bikes come with a wide range of gearing options to conquer diverse terrain. They often feature compact or sub-compact chainsets paired with wide-range cassettes, providing ample gear ratios for climbing steep hills and cruising on flat roads. Some models may also offer single-chainring setups for simplicity and weight savings.</p>

        <h2>Brakes:</h2>
        <p>The most common braking systems on gravel bikes are disc brakes, offering reliable stopping power in all conditions. Hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent modulation and control, allowing riders to confidently navigate descents and technical sections. Disc brakes also offer clearance for wider tires and mudguards, enhancing versatility.</p>

        <h2>Measurements and Statistics:</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Specification</th>
