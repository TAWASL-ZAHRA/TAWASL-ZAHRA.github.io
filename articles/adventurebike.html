    <img src="07-removebg-preview.png" alt="adventure Bike">
    <p>Adventure bikes, also known as ADV bikes, are purpose-built motorcycles designed to tackle a wide range of terrain, from smooth highways to rugged off-road trails. These versatile machines offer riders the freedom to explore the world, whether it's a cross-country road trip or an off-grid adventure. Let's delve into the features, parts, and specifications that make adventure bikes the ultimate exploration machines.</p>

    <div class="specs">
        <h2>Frame and Construction:</h2>
        <p>Adventure bikes feature robust frames constructed from materials like aluminum or steel. These frames provide stability and durability while remaining lightweight enough for off-road maneuvers. The frame geometry is designed for comfort during long rides, with an upright riding position that reduces fatigue.</p>

        <h2>Engine and Performance:</h2>
        <p>Adventure bikes come equipped with powerful engines designed for both on-road performance and off-road capability. Engine sizes typically range from 600cc to 1200cc, providing ample power for highway cruising and dirt trail exploration. These engines are tuned for a broad torque curve, making them responsive in various riding conditions.</p>

        <h2>Suspension and Handling:</h2>
        <p>One of the key features of adventure bikes is their advanced suspension systems. These bikes are equipped with long-travel suspension forks and rear shock absorbers, allowing them to handle rough terrain with ease. The suspension is adjustable, allowing riders to customize the setup based on their preferences and the terrain they're riding on.</p>

        <h2>Wheels and Tires:</h2>
        <p>Adventure bikes come with a combination of on-road and off-road tires, providing traction and stability in different conditions. The wheels are usually spoked for durability, with sizes ranging from 17 to 21 inches. The tires have a dual-sport tread pattern, offering grip on pavement and dirt alike.</p>
