    <h1>Cargo Bikes: Redefining Urban Transport</h1>
    <img src="cargo-removebg-preview.png" alt="cargoBike">
    
    <p>Cargo bikes, also known as freight bikes or utility bikes, are a practical and eco-friendly solution for transporting goods and passengers in urban environments. Let's explore the features, parts, and specifications that make cargo bikes an essential tool for modern-day transportation.</p>

    <div class="specs">
        <h2>Frame and Construction:</h2>
        <p>Cargo bikes are characterized by their sturdy frames, designed to carry heavy loads. These frames are often made of steel or aluminum to ensure durability and stability. Cargo bike frames come in various configurations, including longtails, box bikes, and trikes, each offering unique advantages for different types of cargo and terrain.</p>

        <h2>Cargo Options:</h2>
        <p>Cargo bikes can accommodate a wide range of cargo configurations, from open platforms and baskets to enclosed boxes and racks. Some cargo bikes feature large front-mounted containers, allowing for easy loading and unloading of bulky items such as groceries, furniture, or even children. Others may have extended rear racks or trailers for hauling larger loads.</p>

        <h2>Gearing and Brakes:</h2>
        <p>Cargo bikes are equipped with reliable gearing systems to handle the added weight of cargo. They typically feature wide-ranging gear ratios and strong brakes to ensure smooth and controlled riding, even when fully loaded. Disc brakes are common on cargo bikes for their superior stopping power and durability.</p>

        <h2>Electric Assistance:</h2>
        <p>Many cargo bikes come with electric-assist motors to provide extra power when navigating hills or carrying heavy loads. These motors help reduce rider fatigue and make cargo bikes accessible to a wider range of cyclists, including those with physical limitations. Electric cargo bikes offer varying levels of assistance, allowing riders to choose the amount of motor assistance they need.</p>

        <h2>Measurements and Statistics:</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Specification</th>
                <th>Range</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Overall Length</td>
                <td>200cm to 250cm</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Overall Width</td>
                <td>70cm to 100cm</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Weight</td>
                <td>20kg to 40kg</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Special Features:</h2>
        <p>Cargo bikes often come with additional features to enhance versatility and functionality. These may include integrated lights for nighttime visibility, puncture-resistant tires for added durability, and adjustable seating to accommodate riders of different heights. Some cargo bikes also offer modular accessories such as rain covers, child seats, and cargo nets to customize the bike for specific needs.</p>
