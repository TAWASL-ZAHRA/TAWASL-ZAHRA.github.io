    <h1>Exploring the World of Tricycles: A Guide to Features and Specifications</h1>
    <img src="tricycle-removebg-preview.png" alt="Tricycle">
    
    <p>Tricycles, often associated with childhood joyrides, are now making a comeback in the adult world, offering a blend of nostalgia, practicality, and unique features. Let's delve into the intricacies of these three-wheeled wonders, exploring their parts, specifications, and what makes them special.</p>

    <div class="specs">
        <h2>Frame and Construction:</h2>
        <p>Tricycle frames are typically made of steel, aluminum, or sometimes carbon fiber for higher-end models. The choice of material affects the tricycle's weight, durability, and overall performance. Steel frames offer robustness, aluminum brings lightweight agility, while carbon fiber delivers strength without the added weight.</p>

        <h2>Wheels and Tires:</h2>
        <p>Unlike bicycles, tricycles have one wheel in the front and two in the back, providing stability and balance. Wheel sizes vary, but common measurements for adult tricycles range from 20 to 26 inches in diameter. Tires can be pneumatic or solid rubber, with pneumatic tires providing a smoother ride and better shock absorption, while solid rubber tires require less maintenance.</p>

        <h2>Gearing and Drivetrain:</h2>
        <p>Tricycles may feature single-speed, internally geared, or externally geared drivetrains. Single-speed tricycles are straightforward and low-maintenance, ideal for casual rides. Internally geared hubs offer multiple speeds without the exposed components of external gears, ensuring reliability and ease of use.</p>

        <h2>Brakes:</h2>
        <p>Most tricycles come equipped with hand-operated rim brakes or disc brakes for reliable stopping power. Disc brakes offer better performance in wet conditions and require less effort to operate, enhancing safety and control.</p>

        <h2>Measurements and Statistics:</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Specification</th>
                <th>Range</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Overall Length</td>
                <td>65 to 75 inches</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Overall Width</td>
                <td>30 to 35 inches</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Weight Capacity</td>
                <td>250 to 400 pounds</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Special Features:</h2>
        <p>Some tricycles come with specialized features like cargo baskets, electric assistance, adjustable seating, and even foldable designs for easy storage and transportation. These features enhance versatility and cater to a wide range of user needs.</p>
