    <h1>Chopper Bikes: Riding the Wild Side</h1>
    <img src="03-removebg-preview.png" alt="chopperBike">
    
    <p>Chopper bikes are the epitome of freedom and rebellion on two wheels, with their distinctive style and custom-built designs. Let's delve into the features, parts, and specifications that define these iconic motorcycles.</p>

    <div class="specs">
        <h2>Frame and Construction:</h2>
        <p>Chopper bikes are characterized by their elongated and exaggerated front forks, giving them a stretched-out appearance. The frame is often custom-built, with a long and low profile that puts the rider in a laid-back position. These frames are typically made of steel, providing strength and stability while riding.</p>

        <h2>Engine and Performance:</h2>
        <p>Chopper bikes are usually powered by large-displacement V-twin engines, known for their torquey performance and throaty exhaust notes. Engine sizes can range from 1000cc to over 2000cc, delivering ample power for highway cruising and spirited rides. Custom exhaust systems are common, adding to the bike's aggressive sound and style.</p>

        <h2>Suspension and Handling:</h2>
        <p>Traditional chopper bikes feature a rigid frame with no rear suspension, giving them a bumpy ride but enhancing their vintage aesthetic. However, modern choppers may incorporate rear suspension systems for improved comfort without sacrificing style. The front suspension is often limited to the long front forks, providing a unique riding experience.</p>

        <h2>Wheels and Tires:</h2>
        <p>Chopper bikes typically feature large-diameter wheels with thin tires, contributing to their sleek and streamlined look. The front wheel can range from 21 to 30 inches in diameter, while the rear wheel may be slightly smaller. Wide rear tires add to the bike's aggressive stance and improve traction on the road.</p>

        <h2>Measurements and Statistics:</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Specification</th>
